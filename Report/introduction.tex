%When skydiving there can be situations when
In the trajectory of a skydiver there is a critical point where he should switch on his parachute. After this point consequences can be disastrous if he hasn't switched it on yet. Our aim is to predict the skydiver's height in order to the parachute switches on automatically when he is too near of the floor.\\
%improve his security.\\
We design a model based on free fall law and wind drag force. Furthermore, we have some data about six different skydivers. The idea is to use our ODE model and the available data to predict the skydiver's height.
