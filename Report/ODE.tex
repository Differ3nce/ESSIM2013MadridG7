We find that the z-acceleration is $\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = \frac{D}{m} - g$, where $D$ is the wind drag \eqref{eq:WindDrag}, $g=9.81$ m$/$s$^2$ is the gravitational acceleration and $m$ is the mass of the diver.
After inserting we receive the following equation
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2z}{dt^2}=\frac{1}{2m}\rho(z)\left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2\underbrace{c_{D}A}_{=:c^*(t)}-g,
\end{align}
with $\rho(z) = \rho _0 \left( \frac{T_0+L_0 z}{T_0}\right) ^{(-\frac{gM}{R^*L_0})-1}$.
In the following we will assume that the parameter $c^*$ is constant over the time.
