During the skydiving a small device samples data every $0.25$ s which is used to determine the skydiver's height and velocity. The sampled data includes a lot of noise due to the skydiver rotating and changing position all the time. Therefore the height and velocity can not be estimated accurately. So our goal is to reduce sampled noise.
