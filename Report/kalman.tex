We begin with writing our ODE as a system of first order ODE:s.
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = \frac{D}{m} - g \Longleftrightarrow 
	\left\lbrace
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\dot{h}= v & , h(t_0)=h_0 \\
		\dot{v}= \frac{1}{2m}\varrho v^2c_DA-g& , v(t_0)=v_0
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
The extended Kalman filter can be formulated as
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:model}
	\begin{array}{l}
		\Bx_k = \xVec= f(\Bx_{k-1})+\Bw_{k-1}\\
		\Bz_k = \zVec=  c(\Bx_k)+\Bv_k
	\end{array}	
\end{equation*}
where $f(\Bx_k)$ is the state function(?) and $c(h,v) = \cField$ is the observation function(?). \\
Further on both $\Bv$ and $\Bw$ are the state transition and observation noises which are both assumed to be zero mean multivariate Gaussian noises with covariance $\textbf{Q}_k$ and $\textbf{R}_k$ respectively. 

In our case $\BQ_k$ and $\BR_k$ are constant. To find a accurate $\BQ_k$ we have to study a large database of samples but since we do not have it we have to rely on 
intuition. Therefore we choose $\BQ_k = \QMatrix$ where $5$ and $0.2$ is a guess of the standard deviation of the height respective the velocity. 

On the other hand $\BR_k$ was partly determined by intuition because only the standard deviation of the height $\sigma = 15$m was given by the company.  So we have $\BR_k = \RMatrix$.

First we have to discretize the model \eqref{eq:model} to find the state function(?) $f(\Bx_k)$ and observation function(?) $c(\Bx_k)$. We do this by applying a four step Runge-Kutta method. 

Now we are ready to apply the extended Kalman filter. The process of applying the extended Kalman filter can divided into two parts predict and update.\\

\subsubsection*{Predict}
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{6cm}\=\kill
Predicted state estimate \> $\hat{\Bx}_{k|k-1}=f(\hat{\Bx}_{k-1|k-1})$ \\
Predicted covariance estimate\>$\BP_{k|k-1} = \BF_{k-1}\BP_{k-1|k-1}\BF_{k-1}^T+\textbf{Q}_{k-1}$
\end{tabbing}
\subsubsection*{Update}
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{8cm}\=\kill
Innovation or measurement residual\> $\tilde{\By}= \Bz_k-c(\hat{\Bx}_{k|k-1})$\\
Innovation (or residual) covariance\> $\BS_k=\BC_k\BP_{k|k-1}\BC^T_k+\textbf{R}_k$\\
Near-optimal Kalman gain\> $\BK=\BP_{k|k-1}\BC^T_k\BS^{-1}_k$\\
Updated state estimate\> $\hat{\Bx}_{k|k}=\hat{\Bx}_{k|k-1}+\BK_k\tilde{\By}_k$\\
Updated estimate covariance\> $\BP_{k|k}=(\textbf{I}-\BK_k\BC_k)\BP_{k|k-1}$
\end{tabbing}
where the state transition matrix are defined to be the following Jacobians
\begin{equation*}
	\BF_{k-1}=\left. \frac{\partial f}{\partial \Bx}\right|_{{\hat{\Bx}_{k-1|k-1},			\Bu_{k-1}}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\BC_{k}=\left. \frac{\partial c}{\partial \Bx}\right|_{{\hat{\Bx}_{k|k-1},			\Bu_{k-1}}}
\end{equation*}
